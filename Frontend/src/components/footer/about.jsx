          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            ComicPlane was founded in May 2023 with one simple goal: to create
            and grow a comic book geek community that fosters creativity,
            connection, and collaboration. We saw a need for a platform where
            comic lovers and creators could come together in one place, and we
            set out to build a welcoming, engaging, and accessible space for
            all. Our team is passionate about comics and aims to be a driving
            force in the evolution of comic book culture, offering a platform
            that allows creators to showcase their talents and engage with fans.
